# Analysis Report: AUC-ROC Curve (Model Evaluation)

This section documents the function and interpretation of the **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic)** curve as an evaluation metric for classification models.

## I. Key Functionality and Evaluation Insights

| **Observation** | **Technical Synthesis** |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| *"It's quite good, we can compare models by comparing the area."* | The primary utility is **Model Comparison** using the Area Under the Curve (AUC). AUC quantifies the overall ability of a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative classes. An **AUC value of 1.0** indicates perfect separation, while **0.5** indicates random guessing. |
| *"and also find the optimal threshold value for our binary classification problem."* | The curve is essential for **Threshold Selection**. The point on the curve closest to the **top-left corner** (high TPR, low FPR) typically represents the **optimal probability threshold**, balancing False Positives and False Negatives effectively. |

## II. Curve Structure and Multi-Class Support

| **Observation** | **Technical Synthesis & Clarification** |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| *"The relation between the TPR and FPR are not linear ofc they differ and we get an upper L shape curve between 0 and 1."* | The curve plots the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** (y-axis) against the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** (x-axis) across all possible decision thresholds. The ideal shape is **convex**, bending sharply toward the top-left corner, which demonstrates **strong discriminative power**. |
| *"i don't know it's work for multi class or not so pls add that point if i'm missing that."* | The standard ROC curve is inherently **Binary**. To apply it to **Multi-Class Problems (K > 2)**, methods like **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** are used. This computes *K* separate AUC scores, each measuring how well the model distinguishes one class from all others. The scores are usually **averaged** to obtain an overall AUC metric. |
